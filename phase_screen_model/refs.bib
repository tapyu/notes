  abstract = {With the advent of satellite communications systems at frequencies varying from\textbackslash sim140MHz to 1600 MHz as well as navigation and ranging systems in the 1200-1600 MHz portions of the spectrum, the effect of equatorial irregularities on fading signals has become of importance. Recent observations of the signal statistics of scintillations at frequencies ranging from 136 MHz to 6 GHz reveals a power law fall off of irregularity sizes. Power spectra are now available for a variety of conditions and for frequencies from VHF to microwaves. During periods of intense equatorial activity, at frequencies to 360 MHz, Rayleigh scattering is frequently experienced. The latitudinal extent of the scintillation irregularity region has been established with a half occurrence width during years of moderate solar flux of plus and minus12\textbackslash deg. A correlation of in-situ measurements of irregularities from satellites had revealed the great variations in longitudinal patterns during any season. It has also allowed the\textbackslash Delta Nobtained from in-situ measurements to be utilized to predict scintillation excursions. New facets of scintillation activity in the equatorial region recently reported include weak daytime scintillation and the patchy nature of irregularities (small irregularities embedded in large structures) particularly noted during periods of low solar flux. Future studies will assist in the delineation of the extent of the equatorial region at frequencies from 1.5 to 6 GHz, and in the UHF range. From the viewpoint of the communicator the morphology of scintillations at microwaves has still not been reported from any long term program of measurements.},

  abstract = {The continuous phase modulation (CPM) signaling scheme has gained interest in recent years because of its attractive spectral properties. Data symbol pulse shaping has previously been studied with regard to spectra, for binary data and modulation index 0.5. In this paper these results have been extended to theM-ary case, where the pulse shaping is over a one symbol interval, the so-called full response systems. Results are given for modulation indexes of practical interest, concerning both performance and spectrum. Comparisons are made with minimum shift keying (MSK) and systems have been found which are significantly better inE\_b/N\_0for a large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) without expanded bandwidth. Schemes with the same bit error probability as MSK but with considerably smaller bandwidth have also been found. Significant improvement in both power and bandwidth are obtained by increasing the number of levelsMfrom 2 to 4.},

  abstract = {In the last 5~years there have been a large number of new time series classification algorithms proposed in the literature. These algorithms have been evaluated on subsets of the 47 data sets in the University of California, Riverside time series classification archive. The archive has recently been expanded to 85 data sets, over half of which have been donated by researchers at the University of East Anglia. Aspects of previous evaluations have made comparisons between algorithms difficult. For example, several different programming languages have been used, experiments involved a single train/test split and some used normalised data whilst others did not. The relaunch of the archive provides a timely opportunity to thoroughly evaluate algorithms on a larger number of datasets. We have implemented 18 recently proposed algorithms in a common Java framework and compared them against two standard benchmark classifiers (and each other) by performing 100 resampling experiments on each of the 85 datasets. We use these results to test several hypotheses relating to whether the algorithms are significantly more accurate than the benchmarks and each other. Our results indicate that only nine of these algorithms are significantly more accurate than both benchmarks and that one classifier, the collective of transformation ensembles, is significantly more accurate than all of the others. All of our experiments and results are reproducible: we release all of our code, results and experimental details and we hope these experiments form the basis for more robust testing of new algorithms in the future.},

  abstract = {The phase scintillation index (σϕ), equal to the standard deviation of measured phase, is often used to characterize Global Positioning System (GPS) observations in ionospheric environments that may be scintillated. Since σϕ is dominated by large-scale fluctuations, questions of usage and interpretation exist as will be illustrated here. Beyond traditional concerns with detrending, multipath and receiver phase noise, there are at least two issues to be considered. The first is the marginal suitability of σϕ to characterize a power law phase screen with a poorly defined low-frequency component (e.g., outer scale). Second, observed σϕ parameters may not be relevant to GPS receiver tracking impacts. These arguments are outlined here in greater detail and are illustrated with simple one-dimensional phase screen propagation modeling results. The conclusion is that GPS σϕ values depend critically on the circumstances of measurement and are difficult to compare among observations without additional knowledge, particularly of relative ionospheric drift and irregularity orientation, that may not be available from an isolated GPS receiver. The development of suitable alternative measures requires careful consideration of the elements of GPS scintillation and its impacts. The broader GPS scintillation community should take an active role in developing suitable replacement measures for σϕ.},

  abstract = {Abstract. This paper gives a brief overview over the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) project and model. IRI is recognized as the official standard for the ionosphere by the International Standardization Organization (ISO), the International Union of Radio Science (URSI), the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR), and the European Cooperation for Space Standardization (ECCS). Of great importance are the external drivers of the model that help IRI to represent ionospheric conditions as realistically as possible. The paper discusses the drivers currently used presents recent improvements and changes. Besides the standard solar, magnetic, and ionospheric indices the paper also reports on the adjustment of the model with data and equivalent indices and on the progress towards a Real-Time IRI using data assimilation. IRI has been widely validated with many different data sources and has fared very well in community wide assessment studies. We present some of these studies and document the wide usages of the model in the scientific literature. Finally, we present an outlook on things to come in IRI-2018 and thereafter.},

Tney are interpreted as due to Rayleigh scattering by spatial irregularities in the distribution of electron‐density at or above a definite level in the               F               ‐region. Because of the highly dispersive nature of the ionosphere, there is no marked dependence of Rayleigh scattering upon wave‐frequency such as there is for a non‐dispersive medium. According to this interpretation, variation of the maximum wave‐frequency to which diffuse echoes can be followed has nothing to do with variation of the maximum electron‐density of an ionospheric region, but merely indicates variation in the size of irregularities in electron‐density. Scattering of this type may have some bearing upon the phenomenon of persistence of               E               ‐region echoes to wave‐frequencies greater than the critical penetration‐frequency of the               E               ‐region.},

  abstract = {The theory of the variation of the depth of amplitude scintillations with the zenith angle of the source is considered, for radio waves received from a star or a satellite. It is assumed that irregular phase fluctuations are impressed on the wave in travelling through the ionosphere, and that the amplitude fluctuations develop by a diffraction process as the wave propagates in the free space beneath the ionosphere. Two effects are produced by an increase in the zenith angle of the source. The magnitude of the phase perturbations increases, because the thickness of the ionosphere along the line of sight increases, and the geometry of the diffraction process changes. Theoretical results are given, both for Isotropic irregularities and for irregularities elongated along the direction of the earth's magnetic field. The advantages of observing simultaneously on two wavelengths are stressed. Some comparisons with available experimental data are made, and suggestions are made for future experiments. Irregularities at different distances from the observer are not equally effective in producing amplitude scintillations, and some examples of the “weighting function” which determines their effectiveness are given. Various measures of “scintillation depth” are discussed and related to each other.},

  abstract = {It can be shown that present usage of amplitude modulation does not permit the inherent capabilities of the modulation process to be realized. In order to achieve the ultimate performance of which AM is capable synchronous or coherent detection techniques must be used at the receiver and carrier suppression must be employed at the transmitter. When a performance comparison is made between a synchronous AM system and a single-sideband system it is shown that many of the advantages normally attributed to single sideband no longer exist. SSB has no power advantage over the synchronous AM (DSB) system and SSB is shown to be more susceptible to jamming. The performance of the two systems with regard to multipath or selective fading conditions is also discussed. The DSB system shows a decided advantage over SSB with regard to system complexity, especially at the transmitter. The bandwidth saving of SSB over DSB is considered and it is shown that factors other than signal bandwidth must be considered. The number of usable channels is not necessarilydoubled by the use of SSB and in many practical situations no increase in the number of usable channels results from the use of SSB. The transmitting and receiving equipment which has been developed under Air Force sponsorship is discussed. The receiving system design involves a local oscillator phase-control system which derives carrier phase information from the sidebands alone and does not require the use of a pilot carrier or synchronizing tone.},

  abstract = {One of the main earth stations that INPE uses to track and control its satellites is located in the city of Cuiabá (15.33◦S, 56.46◦W, dip latitude, 6.1◦S), between the magnetic equator and the peak of the equatorial anomaly. Based on the GISM model, it is determined that the ionospheric scintillation index (S4) for the telemetry link in the S band (2 208 MHz) between Cuiabá station and the SCD2 satellite, depending on the date and time, can reach values greater than 0.8. This is the first study conducted on ionospheric S-band scintillation in this region of the earth. In this article, the channel model for the link and the telemetry receiver architecture are presented, in order to evaluate subsequently some of ionospheric scintillation effects on the functioning of the communication system. The modulation used is OQPSK and a fully-digital demodulator recovers the carrier phase using a Costas loop and synchronizes the symbols using a Gardner synchronizer. The design of OQPSK demodulator is detailed and the impact of ionospheric scintillation on general demodulator performance and on the functioning of its modules is discussed. The system bit error rate, the error variances of the carrier phase and symbol delay in different conditions of severity of ionospheric scintillation were figured out through computer simulation. From the presented results, it is evident that, for the adopted receiver architecture, which was designed for a space channel without scintillation, there is a substancial degradation on performance of the system even for S4 = 0.5 and, for the scenario where S4 = 0.8, the link becomes practically inoperative.},

Multiple scattering of waves caused by volume irregularities of the dielectric constant is considered. The angular power spectrum and the auto-correlation function describing the irregularities of the diffraction field caused by multiple scattering in a thick slab are determined.

  abstract = {This paper treats the problem of tracking the global navigation satellite system's (GNSS) signal phase under ionospheric scintillations and to generate an estimate of the scintillation phase and amplitude. In the case of ionospheric scintillations traditional phase locked loop (PLL) based GNSS receivers have problems to track the signal phase accurately. Moreover, these receivers do not estimate the scintillation phase and amplitude, which is evaluated in ionospheric monitoring applications. Therefore, Kalman filter based phase tracking algorithms have been proposed, which track line-of-sight (LOS) phase and scintillation amplitude and phase separately with different state space models. For modeling the scintillation phase and amplitude auto-regressive (AR) models can be used. In this case the parameters for the AR model have to be estimated together with the LOS and scintillation phase and amplitude. We propose to use a second Kalman filter for the estimation of the AR model parameters. This Kalman filter takes the scintillation phase and amplitude estimates from the first Kalman filter as measurement and the AR model parameters as system state. Simulation results for the global positioning system (GPS) show that the proposed algorithm achieves the same estimation performance for scintillation phase and amplitude as an algorithm with a priori knowledge on the AR model parameters.},

Different models have been used close to the medium (log-normal) and far from it (Rician), and signal behavior in the intermediate zone has been particularly difficult to characterize. In this work, we address experimentally the problem of a general and systematic description in all Fresnel-zone regimes and for all strengths of scatter. We make use of multifrequency, phase-coherent radio signals transmitted through the ionosphere to obtain a bivariate representation of complex-signal statistics and then form conclusions based on chi-square tests of four hypotheses against histograms of intensity and phase. We find that neither the log-normal nor the Gaussian generalization of Rician statistics provides a generally valid and complete description of scintillation but that a two-component model based upon them does. We suggest, further, that equal or superior efficacy might be achieved from a simpler model based on the Nakagami distribution for intensity and the normal distribution for phase. At present no such model exists that can also account for correlation between intensity and phase, which is a salient feature of our observations.},

  abstract = {An introduction to a broad range of topics in deep learning, covering mathematical and conceptual background, deep learning techniques used in industry, and research perspectives.“Written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject.”—Elon Musk, cochair of OpenAI; cofounder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceXDeep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

  abstract = {Post-sunset disturbances in the equatorial ionosphere routinely cause rapid phase and amplitude fluctuations (i.e., scintillation) of radio waves propagating through the disturbed regions. The intensity of scintillations is positively correlated with the solar cycle and the associated signal fades will often exceed 20 dB at L-band frequencies during solar maximum. The effect of such an environment on the performance of GPS navigation systems is poorly understood. In March 2000 AFRL conducted a campaign at Ascension Island to test the performance of several GPS receivers under potentially severe scintillation conditions. Ascension Island is located at approximately 16o S magnetic latitude, a region of intense ionospheric disturbances. The systems tested included a Plessey GPS Builder, a Novatel-based prototype GPS Silicon Valley (GSV) Ionospheric Scintillation Monitor (ISM) modified specifically for scintillation applications, a custom High Gain Advanced GPS Receiver (HAGR) developed for AFRL by NAVSYS Corporation and an Ashtech Z-12. Overall, the Ashtech proved to be very robust at tracking the carrier signal amplitude and phase, but it experienced scintillation-induced navigation outages on four of the eight nights of observations. The responses of the different receivers during severe scintillation varied significantly, suggesting that models to simulate ionospheric effects on GPS performance must be receiver-specific.},

  abstract = {Simon Haykin has written two books with Wiley for Communications Systems, Introduction to Digital and Analog Communications, 2e and the forthcoming revision of his classic Communications Systems, 5e. The second edition of Introduction to Digital and Analog Communications, 2e is written at an accessible level and serves as an introductory treatment of communication theory, both ana-log and digital communications. Given the highly mathematical nature of communication theory, it is rather easy for the reader to lose sight of the practical side of communication systems. Throughout the book, the authors have made a special effort to move through the mathe-matical treatment at an easy-to-grasp level, and also to point out the practical relevance of the theory wherever it is appropri-ate to do so.~ Drs. Haykin’s other text, Communication Systems reaches out to a higher level of math rigor. Also, Introduction to Digital and Analog Communications, 2e offers the probability coverage later in the book (chapter 8) since probability theory is not critical to the understanding of modulation. This also contributes to the accessible approach of the text. Introduction to Digital and Analog Communications, 2e is self-contained and suited for a one or two-semester course in communica-tion systems taken by Electrical Engineering juniors or seniors. The book offers flexibility for organizing the course material to suit the interests of course professors and students. Reviewer Quotes: My current textbook by Proakis/Salehi: Communication Systems Engineering, 2e did not meet my student’s capabilities and expecta-tions. The textbook is too complicated and overloaded with heavy mathematical equations. The material is not always logically presented. Not to mention, there is 800 pages of text. I was impressed with Haykin/Moher’s: Introduction to Digital and Analog Communications, 2e and the straightforward comprehensive material coverage of the basic principles of communication theory. Also, the text is logically written with easy to follow and understand mathematical equations and examples. Absolutely, I would like to use this textbook for my communications systems class as soon as it will be possible.”~~~~ Andrei Pet-rov- Idaho State University “ Overall, I found the concepts are clearly explained, the chapters are well motivated by their introductions, “Lessons to be learned” at the beginning of each chapter are particularly appealing, and concluded with well put summaries.~ A very well-written introductory text to grasp the basics of communication systems.” Aylin Yener-Penn State University},

  abstract = {A scintillation signal model and a Global Positioning System (GPS)-Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) receiver model are developed. The scintillation signal model is based on a Nakagami-m distribution for intensity and a Gaussian distribution with zero mean for phase. The GPS-WAAS receiver model includes Link 1 (L1) GPS and WAAS carrier-and C/A-code-tracking loops, as well as semicodeless Link 2 (L2) carrier and Y-code tracking capabilities. The results show that noncoherent delay locked loops (DLLs) typically used for code tracking are very robust to both amplitude and phase scintillation. Carrier-phase-tracking loops are much more susceptible to scintillation, and the signal-to-noise threshold for reliable carrier tracking is very dependent on the scintillation strength. Fortunately, it appears that the worst case scintillation encountered at midlatitudes, including the United States, does not significantly impact L1 carrier-tracking performance. Semicodeless tracking of the L2 carrier is shown to be very fragile. Even weak scintillation can cause loss of L2 carrier lock for low-elevation satellites.},

The model can be used to test Global Positioning System phase tracking loops for scintillation robustness because it captures the scintillation properties that affect such loops. In the model, scintillation amplitude is assumed to follow a Rice distribution, and the spectrum of the rapidly-varying component of complex scintillation is assumed to follow that of a low-pass second-order Butterworth filter. These assumptions are justified, and the model validated, by comparison with phase-screen-generated and empirical scintillation data in realistic tracking loop tests. The model can be mechanized as a scintillation simulator that expects only two input parameters: the scintillation index S 4 and the decorrelation time tau0. Hardware-in-the-loop tests show how the model can be used to test the scintillation robustness of any compatible GPS receiver.},

  abstract = {Ionospheric phase scintillation can cause errors or outage in GNSS navigation solutions. Timely detection of phase scintillation will enable adaptive processing to mitigate its effects on navigation solutions. This paper presents a machine-learning algorithm to autonomously detect phase scintillation based on frequency domain features. Validation using data from Gakona shows phase scintillation detection accuracy around 92 percent. Test results using data from Poker Flat, Jicamarca, Singapore, and Hong Kong demonstrate the capability of the trained detector to be applied more generally. Performance evaluation reveals that the values of phase scintillation index σϕ may be poor indications of scintillation activities. Concurrent phase and amplitude scintillation detection using similar machine-learning algorithms is further investigated with low-latitude data. Results suggest that at low latitudes an amplitude detector alone is sufficient to capture scintillation in general, while at high latitudes, a phase scintillation detector is necessary to capture the dominating phase scintillation events.

  abstract = {This paper presents a physics-based, data-consistent, multi-frequency GPS scintillation signal simulator for dynamic platforms in the equatorial region. This simulator is based on a two-dimensional two-component power-law phase screen model which is described by a compact set of parameters. The parameters are extracted from a set of real scintillation data which we call the initializer. To obtain the scintillation signal’s signatures perceived from receivers on dynamic platforms, we focus our investigation on the time scale factor, which determines the decorrelation time of the simulation signal. The time scale factor is affected by various factors including propagation geometry, irregularity drift velocity and dynamics of the receiver platform. The paper presents analysis of simulated scintillation signals for both stationary and dynamic platforms. For stationary receivers, comparison between the initializer and the simulation data are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the simulator. For dynamic receivers, the influence of the platform dynamics on the simulation signal with respect to the geomagnetic field direction and the irregularity drift velocity is explored. The model presented in this paper will provide a viable tool for simulating GPS scintillation signals intercepted by receivers on dynamic platforms. This tool will aid the design for robust receiver processing algorithms during scintillation for dynamic platforms.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

  abstract = {The effect of equatorial ionospheric scintillations on the operation of GPS receivers is investigated, with special attention given to the effect of scintillation timescales on the code division multiple access (CDMA) protocol used by GPS. We begin by examining the timescales of scintillation fades modeled as a horizontally drifting pattern whose timescales are determined by the Fresnel length and the drift speed. The model is tested by comparing the speed, determined by dividing the Fresnel length by the autocorrelation time (width), with the speed estimated using spaced receivers, and the two independent estimates of speed are shown to possess a linear relationship. Next we show that the scintillation pattern drift speed is given by the difference of the ionospheric drift and the speed of the GPS signal F region puncture point. When the ionosphere and GPS signal puncture point speeds match, the fade timescales lengthen. Additionally, if the fade depth is adequate, during periods of longer fade times the loss of receiver lock on GPS signals is more likely, as shown in several examples; that is, both larger fade depths and longer fade timescales are required to produce loss of tracking. We conclude by demonstrating that speed matching or resonance between the ionosphere and receiver is most likely when the receiver is moving from west to east at speeds of 40–100 m/s (144–360 km/h). This is in the range of typical aircraft speeds.},

  abstract = {Ionospheric scintillations are one of the earliest known effects of space weather. Caused by ionization density irregularities, scintillating signals change phase unexpectedly and vary rapidly in amplitude. GPS signals are vulnerable to ionospheric irregularities and scintillate with amplitude variations exceeding 20 dB. GPS is a weak signal system and scintillations can interrupt or degrade GPS receiver operation. For individual signals, interruption is caused by fading of the in‐phase and quadrature signals, making the determination of phase by a tracking loop impossible. Degradation occurs when phase scintillations introduce ranging errors or when loss of tracking and failure to acquire signals increases the dilution of precision. GPS scintillations occur most often near the magnetic equator during solar maximum, but they can occur anywhere on Earth during any phase of the solar cycle. In this article we review the subject of GPS and ionospheric scintillations for scientists interested in space weather and engineers interested in the impact of scintillations on GPS receiver design and use.},

  abstract = {GPS L1 C/A signal scintillation data were collected at the equatorial anomaly over a period of three months using five receivers spaced on magnetic east-west and north-south axes to examine the speed, orientation, shape, width, and duration of GPS scintillation fade patterns. The nighttime speeds were primarily eastward in the range of 100–200 m/s with a significant spread to both larger values and negative (westward) values as expected, given the known behavior of ionospheric drifts and GPS signal path movement. The characteristic velocity was found to be small so that the true velocity was equal to the apparent velocity to a very good approximation. The orientation of the scintillation fade patterns was organized by a simple projection model of the magnetic field along the GPS signal path onto the horizontal plane when the signal paths were aligned no closer than 60° from the magnetic field. The shape of the scintillation fade pattern was greatly elongated in the magnetic north-south direction, and no change could be detected over a distance of 1 km. The east-west widths of the scintillation fade patterns were variable, but after normalizing to the elevation angle, accounting for the fade orientation, and eliminating signal paths within 60° of the magnetic field, an organized scale length of about 450 m was determined. The duration of the scintillation fade patterns was examined using the optimal cross-correlation amplitude as a measure of change. For a 5 s duration, 49\% of the optimal cross-correlation amplitudes exceed a value of 0.8.},

First, we study sparse tensors, which have the property that the vast majority of the elements are zero. We propose storing sparse tensors using coordinate format and describe the computational efficiency of this scheme for various mathematical operations, including those typical to tensor decomposition algorithms. Second, we study factored tensors, which have the property that they can be assembled from more basic components. We consider two specific types: A Tucker tensor can be expressed as the product of a core tensor (which itself may be dense, sparse, or factored) and a matrix along each mode, and a Kruskal tensor can be expressed as the sum of rank-1 tensors. We are interested in the case where the storage of the components is less than the storage of the full tensor, and we demonstrate that many elementary operations can be computed using only the components. All of the efficiencies described in this paper are implemented in the Tensor Toolbox for MATLAB.},

  abstract = {Several alternative distance measures for comparing time series have recently been proposed and evaluated on time series classification (TSC) problems. These include variants of dynamic time warping (DTW), such as weighted and derivative DTW, and edit distance-based measures, including longest common subsequence, edit distance with real penalty, time warp with edit, and move–split–merge. These measures have the common characteristic that they operate in the time domain and compensate for potential localised misalignment through some elastic adjustment. Our aim is to experimentally test two hypotheses related to these distance measures. Firstly, we test whether there is any significant difference in accuracy for TSC problems between nearest neighbour classifiers using these distance measures. Secondly, we test whether combining these elastic distance measures through simple ensemble schemes gives significantly better accuracy. We test these hypotheses by carrying out one of the largest experimental studies ever conducted into time series classification. Our first key finding is that there is no significant difference between the elastic distance measures in terms of classification accuracy on our data sets. Our second finding, and the major contribution of this work, is to define an ensemble classifier that significantly outperforms the individual classifiers. We also demonstrate that the ensemble is more accurate than approaches not based in the time domain. Nearly all TSC papers in the data mining literature cite DTW (with warping window set through cross validation) as the benchmark for comparison. We believe that our ensemble is the first ever classifier to significantly outperform DTW and as such raises the bar for future work in this area.},

  abstract = {In Global Navigation Satellite Systems, receivers have to cope with ionospheric scintillation, which is of paramount importance for high-precision positioning applications. However, the design of robust carrier tracking techniques under these condition still remains an open problem. The time-varying correlated scintillation phase can be modeled as an AR(p) process, whose linear nature fits very well into the linear Kalman filter formulation and can be embedded into its architecture. State-of-the-art techniques stand for fixed architectures optimized for very specific scenarios, namely the KF-AR(1). In this paper, a new adaptive KF-AR(p) approach with new implementations with high order AR models (AR-2, AR-3) is proposed so as to match better the input scintillation time series in time-varying scenarios, which also include the presence of AWGN noise. Simulation results are provided to show the enhanced performance and adaptability in these scenarios compared to previous approaches such as the standard Kalman filter and the KF-AR(1).}

In the first structure, the Kalman filter innovations are computed by the arctangent phase discriminator, and the state estimates are directly employed in the carrier replica generation. In the second structure, the Kalman filter measurements are the prompt correlator outputs, and the error states are computed and used by a state feedback controller to provide a control signal to drive the carrier replica generation. The nonlinear RBFs provide more flexibility to capture nonlinear dynamics evolving with time, possibly present in the scintillation phase and amplitude. The weights of the RBF networks and the covariance matrices of the process and measurement noise of the Kalman filters are estimated online in the adaptive Kalman PLL structures. Simulations with synthetic severe scintillation data show the capability of the proposed Kalman PLLs to improve robustness to scintillation effects in carrier synchronization, with performance similar to the corresponding structures employing AR scintillation models. Simulations using recorded scintillation data collected by a commercial receiver highlight the learning and generalization capability of the RBF networks to cope with evolving scintillation characteristics over time with possibly nonlinear effects. The Kalman PLL structures employing the RBF networks present reduced errors compared with the structures using AR models.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present in a unified framework the gradient algorithms employed in the adaptation of linear time filters (TF) and the supervised training of (non-linear) neural networks (NN). the optimality criteria used to optimize the parameters H of the filter or network are the least squares (LS) and least mean squares (LMS) in both contexts. They respectively minimize the total or the mean squares of the error e(k) between an (output) reference sequence d(k) and the actual system output y(k) corresponding to the input X(k). Minimization is performed iteratively by a gradient algorithm. the index k in (TF) is time and it runs indefinitely. Thus iterations start as soon as reception of X(k) begins. the recursive algorithm for the adaptation H(k – 1) → H(k) of the parameters is implemented each time a new input X(k) is observed. When training a (NN) with a finite number of examples, the index k denotes the example and it is upper-bounded. Iterative (block) algorithms wait until all K examples are received to begin the network updating. However, K being frequently very large, recursive algorithms are also often preferred in (NN) training, but they raise the question of ordering the examples X(k). Except in the specific case of a transversal filter, there is no general recursive technique for optimizing the LS criterion. However, X(k) is normally a random stationary sequence; thus LS and LMS are equivalent when k becomes large. Moreover, the LMS criterion can always be minimized recursively with the help of the stochastic LMS gradient algorithm, which has low computational complexity. In (TF), X(k) is a sliding window of (time) samples, whereas in the supervised training of (NN) with arbitrarily ordered examples, X(k – 1) and X(k) have nothing to do with each other. When this (major) difference is rubbed out by plugging a time signal at the network input, the recursive algorithms recently developed for (NN) training become similar to those of adaptive filtering. In this context the present paper displays the similarities between adaptive cascaded linear filters and trained multilayer networks. It is also shown that there is a close similarity between adaptive recursive filters and neural networks including feedback loops. The classical filtering approach is to evaluate the gradient by ‘forward propagation’, whereas the most popular (NN) training method uses a gradient backward propagation method. We show that when a linear (TF) problem is implemented by an (NN), the two approaches are equivalent. However, the backward method can be used for more general (non-linear) filtering problems. Conversely, new insights can be drawn in the (NN) context by the use of a gradient forward computation. The advantage of the (NN) framework, and in particular of the gradient backward propagation approach, is evidently to have a much larger spectrum of applications than (TF), since (i) the inputs are arbitrary and (ii) the (NN) can perform non-linear (TF).},

  abstract = {A method is presented for determining the error probability of a receiver using differential detection in the presence of Gaussian noise and fast Rician fading. Equations for the covariances of the fading component are derived, which include the effect of IF filter distortion. It is shown that these equations may be readily evaluated numerically. A simple formula for the error probability is derived for systems using BPSK and a matched filter receiver. An example of the error probability is given using this receiver. Also given is an example of a system using MSK with a practical IF filter. Different spectral shapes and bandwidths for the fading process are investigated for this example and their effect on the error probability is determined.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Equatorial scintillation is a phenomenon that occurs daily in the equatorial region after the sunset and affects radio signals that propagate through the ionosphere. Depending on the temporal and spatial situation, equatorial scintillation can represent a problem in the availability and precision of the Global Positioning System (GPS). This work is concerned with evaluating the impact of equatorial scintillation on the performance of GPS receivers. First, the morphology and statistical model of equatorial scintillation is briefly presented. A numerical model that generates synthetic scintillation data to simulate the effects of equatorial scintillation is presented. An overview of the main theoretical principles on GPS receivers is presented. The analytical models that describe the effects of scintillation at receiver level are presented and compared with numerical simulations using a radio software receiver and synthetic data. The results achieved by simulation agreed quite well with those predicted by the analytical models. The only exception is for links with extreme levels of scintillation and when weak signals are received.},

A Butterworth filter with a constant cutoff frequency of 0.1Hz is commonly used in detrending GPS data. In this study, the performance of this commonly used filter is evaluated and compared with a new wavelet-based detrending method using GPS data from high latitudes. It was observed that in detrending high-latitude GPS data, a wavelet filter performed better than Butterworth filters as the correlation between amplitude- and phase-scintillation indices in S 4 and σ ϕ improved significantly from 0.53, when using a Butterworth filter, to 0.79, when using the wavelet filtering method. We also introduced an improved phase-scintillation index, σ CHAIN, which we think is comparatively a better parameter to represent phase scintillations at high latitudes as the correlation between S 4 and σ CHAIN was as high as 0.90. During the analysis, we also noted that the occurrence of the “phase scintillation without amplitude scintillation” phenomenon was significantly reduced when scintillation indices were derived using the wavelet-based detrending method. These results seem to indicate that wavelet-based detrending is better suited for GPS scintillation signals and also that σ CHAIN is a better parameter for representing GPS phase scintillations at high latitudes.

Her formulation provides a computationally tractable means for analyzing radiowave propagation when ionospheric refraction is a significant effect, as is the case in the high- frequency (HP: 3-30 MHz) band, where shortwave communication systems and over-the-horizon (OTH) radars operate. The study of HP propagation effects on communications and radar systems has formed a substantial portion of my career, and so it is with pleasure that I review the more significant aspects of that work to honor Jenifer Haselgrove (now Jenifer Leech) for her very significant contribution, Haselgrove’ s Equations. I discuss the extension of Haselgrove's Equations for accurate computation of ray focusing and ray homing, and the application of Haselgrove's Equations in HP propagation-channel modeling, simulation of Doppler-spread surface clutter for OTH radar, geo location of targets for OTH radar, and the mitigation of traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) for OTH radar.},

The scintillation effects are measured by two scintillation indices, the amplitude scintillation index S4 and the phase scintillation index ??. These indices are computed from detrended signal power and carrier phase obtained from the receiver tracking loop outputs, respectively. Recent studies show that the values of these indices depend on the detrending method used to remove the non-scintillation effects. This paper presents our investigation of the error sources in the scintillation detrending methods. For amplitude scintillation, the main error source is the detrending filter group delay. For phase scintillation, inappropriate detrending filter cutoff frequency selection is the dominant error contributing factor. The paper presents the error assessment and correction techniques for both detrending methods.},

  abstract = {A fast Monte Carlo technique to simulate equatorial ionospheric scintillation on global navigation satellite system signals is proposed. The algorithm uses a single-layer phase-screen model of the ionosphere and the scintillation is expressed as a Huygens-Fresnel integral (HFI). By assuming a specially-tailored random phase screen, the HFI can be expressed in closed form as a combination of Fresnel integrals. We statistically characterize the amplitude and phase computed by the HFI for different values of the scintillation index S4. Results for the L1, L2, and L5 bands were obtained and compared with real data, showing good agreement. Some of the advantages of the proposed technique are: (a) the amplitude and phase of the scintillation process are simultaneously obtained; (b) arbitrarily long ionospheric scintillation time series with pre-defined stationary characteristics are synthesized; and (c) several scintillation time series corresponding to different carrier frequencies are generated using a common phase-screen model.},

  abstract = {The global navigation satellite systems provide high-quality total electron content (TEC) measurements that are used routinely for ionospheric diagnostics. Large-scale TEC structure is a critical input for maintaining global ionospheric models. However, residual stochastic TEC structure is typically discarded as a phase-scintillation-induced error. In this paper we show that the phase-scintillation errors are a negligibly small fraction of the stochastic TEC component for most global navigation satellite system operating conditions. With three-frequency GPS satellite measurements, two independent TEC measurements can be compared to bound the scintillation-induced errors. Data analysis and simulations show that scintillation-induced errors are a small fraction of one TEC unit as long as the lower contributing frequency S4 index is less than 0.5. To the extent that scintillation-induced errors are negligible, spectral analysis of stochastic TEC provides a direct measure of path-integrated structure. Irregularity parameter estimation can be used to estimate power law parameters, which in turn can be interpreted with a new global ionospheric structure model. We present a summary analysis of month-long series of continuous measurements at Poker Flat, Alaska. The analysis confirms the generally accepted single power law model for high-latitude structure. A small fraction of the measurements indicate an outer-scale transition at approximately 17 km. The general pattern of the structure occurrence is consistent with auroral-zone activity.},

  abstract = {Ionospheric scintillation observations near Boulder, Colorado, from the radio source Cygnus A were spectral analyzed at 26 MHz. The scintillation spectral features are used to calculate the diffraction effects and hence deduce the F-region irregularity wavenumber spectrum for sizes from about 4 to 0.6 km. The wavenumber spectrum on many occasions follows a power-law variation PN(κx) ∝ κx−βH+1, where βH typically varies from 3 to 4. An example based on the Gaussian spectrum shows that the extrapolation to radio frequencies much higher than 26 MHz will not explain the observed equatorial and auroral scintillations. Abrupt changes in electron density are required to support the higher-wavenumber spectral densities that cause these higher-frequency scintillations. These abrupt density changes can be represented by a power-law wavenumber spectrum. The scintillation-deduced power-law variation agrees with in-situ density spectra measurements from the Ogo 6 satellite. Several production mechanisms that follow a power-law variation are discussed. The measurement of the wavenumber spectrum will help explain the mechanism that produces small-scale irregularities.},

However, as the Doppler spread is increased beyond values on the order of the bit rate, performance improves. In the limit as the Doppler spread approaches infinity, with total multipath power held constant, performance approaches that of ideal DPSK as expected.

The new feature of this receiver is that it can also measure the amplitude and phase scintillation indices on the SBAS signal received from a geostationary satellite. This observation, with its fixed link geometry, is particularly interesting for the analysis of temporal variation in the scintillation behavior of the equatorial ionosphere. At the same time it allows a direct assessment of the threat posed by scintillation to the SBAS signal.

  abstract = {\&lt;p\&gt;When a electromagnetic wave propagates through a random inhomogeneous medium, scattering by the refractive index inhomogeneities can lead to a wide variety of phenomena that have been the subject of extensive study and modelling. The Global Ionospheric Scintillation Model (GISM) is primarily intended to model the phenomena relevant for the GNSS applications and provides the amplitude and phase scintillation indices. Due to the three dimensional nature of the GISM model it is capable to describe a variety of communication geometries such as satellite-ground station or satellite-satellite communication link. Moreover, it can calculate the scintillation maps at specific altitude allowing to obtain the 3D picture of scintillation.\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;Recently the GISM model has been handed over to the newly established DLR Institute of Solar-Terrestrial Physics. Since then the model underwent several modernization steps. For example, the programming paradigm has been changed to the object-oriented one in order to bring more flexibility into the code.\&amp;\#160; In the present contribution we present the first results of our works and discuss strategies for further development, extension, and validation of the GISM.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

  abstract = {Many computer models possess high-dimensional input spaces and substantial computational time to produce a single model evaluation. Although such models are often ‘deterministic’, these models suffer from a wide range of uncertainties. We argue that uncertainty quantification is crucial for computer model validation and reproducibility. We present a statistical framework, termed history matching, for performing global parameter search by comparing model output to the observed data. We employ Gaussian process (GP) emulators to produce fast predictions about model behaviour at the arbitrary input parameter settings allowing output uncertainty distributions to be calculated. History matching identifies sets of input parameters that give rise to acceptable matches between observed data and model output given our representation of uncertainties. Modellers could proceed by simulating computer models’ outputs of interest at these identified parameter settings and producing a range of predictions. The variability in model results is crucial for inter-model comparison as well as model development. We illustrate the performance of emulation and history matching on a simple one-dimensional toy model and in application to a climate model.

  abstract = {Processing data from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) always requires time synchronization between transmitter and receiver clocks. Due to the limited stability of the receiver’s internal oscillator, the offset of the receiver clock with respect to the system time has to be estimated for every observation epoch or eliminated by processing differences between simultaneous observations. If, in contrast, the internal oscillator of the receiver is replaced by a stable atomic clock one can try to model the receiver clock offset, instead of estimating it on an epoch-by-epoch basis. In view of the progress made in the field of high-precision frequency standards we will investigate the technical requirements for GNSS receiver clock modeling at the carrier phase level and analyze its impact on the precision of the position estimates. If we want to take advantage of the frequency stability provided by a high-performance oscillator in combination with a GNSS receiver we have to ensure that the signal delays inside the receiver hardware remain constant. Therefore, we have analyzed the relative receiver clock offsets for a number of GNSS receivers that derive their frequency reference from a common oscillator. Based on experimental data of an exemplary pair of geodetic receivers we show that the noise from variations of the hardware delays in the receiver electronics does not exceed the receiver clock noise (5ps RMS) when all environmental effects are carefully controlled. By analyzing the elements of the parameter covariance matrix for a simple case of point positioning, the impact of GNSS receiver clock modeling on kinematic and static solutions is studied. Furthermore, we demonstrate the suitability of a single quadratic polynomial to model a receiver clock that is locked to the frequency of an active hydrogen maser for periods up to 24h. Based on simulated and real GNSS data it is shown that receiver clock modeling improves the RMS of the height component of a kinematic Precise Point Positioning (PPP) by up to 70\%, whereas for the static case the gain is almost negligible.},

This simulator is developed based on the two-component power-law phase screen model, which is specified by five parameters and suitable for representation of strong equatorial scintillation. By setting three of the model parameters to representative values, numerical mappings from the user input parameter set (S4 and τ0) to the remaining model parameter subset of two parameters can be established through numerical evaluation. The numerical mappings are then used to drive the scintillation model to generate time series of scintillation amplitude and phase. A large group of strong scintillation data (with S4 {$>$} 0.6) from two equatorial sites are processed to obtain the representative values of the three model default parameters and to validate the numerical parameter mappings. A MATLAB implementation of the scintillation simulator has been made available.},

  abstract = {Time series classification is an important task in time series data mining, and has attracted great interests and tremendous efforts during last decades. However, it remains a challenging problem due to the nature of time series data: high dimensionality, large in data size and updating continuously. The deep learning techniques are explored to improve the performance of traditional feature-based approaches. Specifically, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) framework is proposed for time series classification. Different from other feature-based classification approaches, CNN can discover and extract the suitable internal structure to generate deep features of the input time series automatically by using convolution and pooling operations. Two groups of experiments are conducted on simulated data sets and eight groups of experiments are conducted on real-world data sets from different application domains. The final experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for time series classification in terms of the classification accuracy and noise tolerance.},
